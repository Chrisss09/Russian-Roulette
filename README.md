<h2>RUSSIAN ROULETTE - Can you catch the Communists?</h2>

<h4>Creating my Memory Game</h4>

<p>For this project I have chosen to create my own memory game called Russian Roulette. After researching different memory games, the one that I have chosen was a great choice for me. It is a simple pair up game with a Russian theme. As per my previous project I have a love for Russian history so I have chosen again to go for a Russian themed memory game where you pair up all the Communists to win the game with a limited amount of turns.</p>
