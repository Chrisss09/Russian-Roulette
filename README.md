<h1>RUSSIAN ROULETTE - Can you catch the Communists?</h1>

<h2>Creating my Memory Game</h2>

<p>For this project I have chosen to create my own memory game called Russian Roulette. After researching different memory games, the one that I have chosen was a great choice for me. It is a simple pair up game with a Russian theme. As per my previous project I have a love for Russian history so I have chosen again to go for a Russian themed memory game where you pair up all the Communists to win the game with a limited amount of turns.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>I have created this app for people like me who have an interest for Russian history and want to have fun with it. On reading the project brief and researching memory games I instantly knew what I wanted to acheive, so I sketched in my writing pad what I wanted it to look like with a list of features to implement.</p>
