<h1>RUSSIAN ROULETTE - Can you catch the Communists?</h1>

<h2>Creating my Memory Game</h2>

<p>For this project I have chosen to create my own memory game called Russian Roulette. After researching different memory games, the one that I have chosen was a great choice for me. It is a simple pair up game with a Russian theme. As per my previous project I have a love for Russian history so I have chosen again to go for a Russian themed memory game where you pair up all the Communists to win the game with a limited amount of turns.</p>

<h2>UX</h2>

<p>I have created this app for people like me who have an interest for Russian history and want to have fun with it. On reading the project brief and researching memory games I instantly knew what I wanted to acheive, so I sketched in my writing pad what I wanted it to look like with a list of features to implement.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>The main feature to my game is to allow the user to click on a card and for it to flip over. I have done this by adding a transform rotate property with a 3D effect. Also I have added a reset button for the user to restart the game at any point.</p>

<h4>Mobile Response</h4>

<p>For this project I have created a seperate CSS page for my mobile response due to the amount I have added. Due to the simplicity of the game I have not changed anything such as hiding anything when on small screens. The mobile response just makes the title of the game smaller and the game board either bigger or smaller depending on what you play it on.</p>

<h4>Future additions</h4>

<p>For this project I had more ideas to expand my game that I would like to look into in the future but I felt I was running out of time. I would of liked to have created a new box underneath the game and when the user would click on a card the box will then show their name and create a match. Also I would of liked to add some sound to the game, if you lose I would have the Soviet National Anthem play and if you win the Russian National Anthem would play.</p>
